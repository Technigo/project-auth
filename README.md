# Project Auth API

This project is a very simple authentication API built with Node.js and Express. It allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes with a valid token.

## The problem

The main challenge was to implement user authentication and authorization. I started by setting up the server with Node.js and Express, and then used the bcrypt library to hash user passwords for secure storage. 

If I had more time, I would implement a password reset feature, add email verification for sign up, and refine the error handling.
