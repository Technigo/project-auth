Projet auth

Your project needs two parts; a backend API, and a React frontend. You'll need to create a `User` model using mongoose, with properties for your registered user, and to store a user's access token.

Then, on the frontend side of things, you'll need to build up a registration form that POSTs to your API. You'll need to store the access token you get back in the browser using local storage, and then use that token when making other requests to your API.

Once a user is logged in, you will need to have one last endpoint which returns some content which only logged-in users should be able to access. You can choose what you want this endpoint to return, and if you want to make multiple endpoints, that's fine too. It could return hard-coded data or something from the database - either is fine. Whatever you choose, it should be displayed in the frontend after you've logged in.



To summarise, your API needs:
- Registration endpoint, to create a new user.
- Sign-in endpoint, to authenticate a returning user.
- An authenticated endpoint which only returns content if the `Authorization` header with the user's token was correct.



Your frontend needs:
- A registration form.
- A sign-in form.
- A page to show the authenticated content from the API.
- A 'sign out' button that removes the saved access token and redirects the user to the login form.


## How to get started üí™üèº
The [project repository](https://github.com/Technigo/project-auth) has a 'frontend' folder which contains the react starter project for you to build the frontend with, and a 'backend' folder with the express starter project to build the API with.

To get started, fork [the repo](https://github.com/Technigo/project-auth), then you will need to use two separate terminal windows to install dependencies, and then run both projects.

For the backend:

1. `cd backend`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

For the frontend:

1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`




## How to hand in the code üéØ
- Navigate to your repo and create a Pull Request into the Technigo repo
- Wait for the code review from your teachers
