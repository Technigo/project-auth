# Project Auth

We have created a authentication flow with registration, login and a secret page with a secret message. The users are stored in a mongo database.

## The problem

We worked with pairprogramming together starting with planning of the project. The server backend was created with mongoose and tested with postman and checked in compass.

Frontend is built with React.js and React Router.
