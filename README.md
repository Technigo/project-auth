# Project Auth API

This fullstack project requires developing a backend to support user registration, login and an authenticated endpoint accessible only to loggen-in users.
The frontend features a startpage, a registration and login form and a page displaying authenticated content. Also sign-out button that removes the access token from local storage and brings the user back to the startpage.

## The problem

I started by using the code from the codealong in the backend, trying to figure out how to do an authentication process and use bycript properly.
Being frustrated with backend I started creating the frontend and for a bit my project was all over the place.
In the end I went back to finish and test backend and then finish a frontend that could also be used for our final project.

If I had more time, I would add a loading animation page, because it takes forever on login and registration.
