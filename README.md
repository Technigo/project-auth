# Project Auth

This was a pair programming project at the Technigo bootcamp. It is an API with authentication and registration, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once the user is logged in.

## The problem

We started out building the backend with a Mongoose user model and endpoints to register a new user, to log in and a secret endpoint that could only be accessed by a logged in user. If the user tries to access the secret page without being logged in an error message is displayed.

## Learning objectives

- How to build a registration flow
- How to handle authentication, both in the frontend and in the backend
- How to build a frontend and backend at the same time

## Tech
