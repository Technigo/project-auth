# Project Auth - Pair programming

In this project we have built an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in.

We have a backend API and a React frontend. 
We have created a User model using mongoose with properties for our registered user, and to store the user's access token.

On the frontend side we have built a registration form which POSTs to our API. We have sored the access token in the browser by using local storage and hen we have used that token when making other request to our API. 

Once the user is logged in, it will see our "secret" endpoint.
