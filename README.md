# Project Auth

This project is a full-stack authentication project with a simple registration and log in flow. The user is authenticated using tokens and passwords are stored securily in a dababase. Forms to register are built in the front end part. Only when the user is logged in they are able to view the protected content.

## The problem

The styling is unfortunately not yet finished. I run into problem with my styled components. The user can't click on the input field, it's probably somehow hidden due to the absolute/relative positionings. I have hard time changing the positioning without some of the effects disappearing.
