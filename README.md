# Project Auth - Pair project - Jessica Nygren Walhed & Daniel Vestin

This week's project was all about tie the skills we've learnt so far to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once the user is logged in. 

## The problem

It was a  bit of a struggle to remember Redux ðŸ˜…. Needed to freshen up our minds a bit. But think we really implemented something that we understand now. This project will really come in handy to go back to for the Final projects.
