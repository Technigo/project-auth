# FloraEcho Flower Online Shop
This project is an online store that sells fresh flowers every week. It comprises two integral parts: the backend API and the React frontend. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, incorporates industry best practices for secure user authentication. MongoDB (or any preferred database) is utilized for persistent data storage. On the frontend, React, coupled with Zustand, orchestrates an intuitive user interface.

## How we work together:
This was a team project. It was a real-world client case. Miko did the basic design. We used Trello to plan how to implement the project. We started by dividing the project into smaller chunks and setting deadlines. We faced many challenges during the implementation of the project. For example, we couldn't sync our coding, and we came from different countries with different cultural backgrounds. However, we overcame the challenges. I kept to our plan, and we had stand-up meetings every day. We tried to understand each other and keep communication open. We helped each other when we had problems. I think this is where we learned the most from this project.
