# Project Auth API

This week, we teamed up with our partner for the Final Project.
focusing on user authentication and security. Throughout this project, we've covered essential topics such as user authentication using tokens, secure password storage, security considerations in frontend and backend code, protection against common web attacks, creating a registration flow, handling authentication on both frontend and backend, and techniques for simultaneous frontend and backend development.

## The problem

The predominant issues we encountered revolved around frontend alerts. While we received the accurate error codes from the backend in the console, the frontend failed to display alerts when attempting to log in or register without filling in the required form fields. This was finally solved by using the logical OR operator (||) in one of the if-statements.
