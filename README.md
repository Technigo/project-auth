# Project Auth API by Nabeel Mansour and Mathilda Karlsson

This week we built a backend API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and member specific content for those who are logged in.



## The problem

We started with the backend using Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose. With a mongoose model and schema for the user we could create a authentication with unique user tokens.

Then we made a frontend with React and Redux, using Routes and Navigation to structure the pages. With an API-fetch we connected backend and frontend to a full application.

If we had more time we would focus some more on the design and the member specific content. We would also add some love to the error messages.
