# Project Auth

this was a two part project where we build a backend API, and a React frontend. we created a backend User model using mongoose, with properties for your registered user, and to store a user's access token.
the frontend showed a registration form which POSTs to the API we build. it login form access the user token that you get back in the browser using local storage, and then use that token when making other requests in our API.
Once a user is logged in, the user is returned with some content which only the user sees when logged-in.
