# Project Auth API

Project Auth is a web application designed to provide user authentication functionalities. The application features a frontend built using React.js and a backend developed with Node.js and Express.js. User data is stored securely in a MongoDB database, and password hashing is implemented using bcrypt for enhanced security.

## The problem

Challenges Encountered:

Backend Setup: Setting up the backend with Node.js and Express.js required careful configuration of routes and middleware for authentication.

Frontend Integration: Integrating the frontend with the backend API endpoints and managing authentication state in React was challenging.

User Authentication and Security: Implementing secure authentication and password hashing with bcrypt and JWT authentication required careful implementation.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Handling CORS issues during development and configuring CORS middleware in the backend were challenges.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, Axios
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt
