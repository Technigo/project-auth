# Project Auth API

This weeks pair-project was made together by Ylva Karlsson and Cecilia Avila at Technigos Web Dev Boot Camp Spring 2023.
The task for W16 of the Boot Camp was to work with an authentication site where a user can register and log in to the site.

This week we learned how to:
✓ How to authenticate users using tokens
✓ How to securely store passwords in your databases
✓ How to think about security and defensive design when building frontend or backend code
✓ Some common attacks which are used against sites and how to protect against them
✓ How to build a registration flow
✓ How to handle authentication, both in the frontend and in the backend
✓ How to build a frontend and backend at the same time

## The problem

We encountered all the problems you can get but in the end we solved the connectivity issues and now the app is working regarding the requirements.
We used Google Cloud to deploy the API, Mongo Atlas to deploy the database where we can store information about authenticated users and their chosen passwords.
We used Postman to try our endpoints and authentication before deploying it live.
Overall quite a hard week with some trouble-shooting but in the end all good and we've learned some new stuff.
