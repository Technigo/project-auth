To summarise, your API needs:

- Registration endpoint, to create a new user.
- Sign-in endpoint, to authenticate a returning user.
- An authenticated endpoint which only returns content if the `Authorization` header with the user's token was correct.

Your frontend needs:

- A registration form.
- A sign-in form.
- A page to show the authenticated content from the API.
- A 'sign out' button that removes the saved access token and redirects the user to the login form.
