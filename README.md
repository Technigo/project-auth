# Project Auth

Week 20 at Technigo's bootcamp was a pair programming project. The brief was to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in.

## The problem

We learned: 
– How to authenticate users using tokens
– How to securely store passwords in our databases
– How to think about security and defensive design when building frontend or backend code
– Some common attacks which are used against sites and how to protect against them
