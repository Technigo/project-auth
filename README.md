# Project Auth

This project was to build an **API with authentication** where a user gets to login and find a secret message. The goal was to implement a registration flow and a frontend with forms where the user can `sign up`, `sign in`, `view a message` and `log out`. This week was all about web-security.

## What we learned

- How to build a registration flow
- How to handle authentication using tokens in both backend and frontend
- How to store and hash passwords in the database using bcrypt and crypto
- How to build both frontend & backend in the same repository
- How to handle errors using Try/Catch
