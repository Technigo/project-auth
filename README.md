# Project Auth API

This project is a simple full-stack application that consists of a backend API and a React frontend. The primary goal is to implement user registration, authentication, and authorization features. The backend is built using Node.js with Express and Mongoose, while the frontend utilizes React.

The project is a pair project made by: Emmy Dieden and Idah Collin

## The problem

This was the first week that working with a mono-repo. We are aware of that the API/keys can be found through GitHubs history.

As the authentication was new to us this was a challenge. The solution was team-work, communication and going through course material as well as discussing with our team mates which had the same challenges.

One of our challenges was to deploy the backend and frontend, both of it worked out by reading material and prompting chatGPT.
