# Project Auth API

This assignment was to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once logged in.

## The problem

Struggled a lot with where to salt the password, then found Technigo's example of how to solve it. This was a hard project and it helped a lot to break it down into lots of little steps. So first I just created the React components with no back end. Then I set up the API endpoints but didn't put any code in them yet. After that I made the login form send a POST request to the API but didn't try to code the login check yet.
