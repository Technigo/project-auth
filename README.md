# Project Auth API

Developed a backend API and frontend registration & sign-in form. 

API uses mongoose to include endpoints for user registration & sign-in, authenticated endpoint accessible only to logged-in users, storing and removing access tokens.


## The problem

We had issues storing the access token, but figured it out by  parsing the token to JSON.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
