# Project Auth API

Developed a backend API and frontend registration & sign-in form. 

API uses mongoose to include endpoints for user registration & sign-in, authenticated endpoint accessible only to logged-in users, storing and removing access tokens.


## The problem

We had issues storing the access token, but figured it out by parsing the token to JSON.
