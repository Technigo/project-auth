# Project Auth API

A fullstack project which allows user to log in and access certain content once the user has signed in.

## The problem

The hard lesson I learnt from this week project was I should always remember to put the environment variables in my deployment setting. It took me quite a while to understand why my site work locally but not the deployment version. This is a nice project to practice authentication and understand how to set up on both frontend and backend.
