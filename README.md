# Project Auth

The project consists in a sign in/ sign up form. Once logged, the user has acess to a restricted page. In the backend, we built an API with user authentication.
Created by Bruna Santos Araujo and Harry BÃ¤cklin

## Features

- Registration form to create a new user and log in
- Restricted content

## Production Process

- We started by creating the post request in the backend to create the new users (username + password).
- We created also a sign in endpoint for sign in registered users.
- We created a simple frontend form and connected it to our backend.
- There is also a restricted page accessible only for registered users.
