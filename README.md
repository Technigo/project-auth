# Project Auth API
This is a web app that users can register for and log into to see a "cheesy", inspirational quote. They can then log out again. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Andrea and Bridget worked together to create an API with three endpoints - one to register, one to log in, and one to show a single quote from a large database. We used MongoDB, mogoose, Compass, and Atlas to develop and deploy the API. We then created a corresponding frontend for users to interact. The frontend is styled with styled components and uses Lottie animations. We pair-programmed to create the first two endpoints - registration and login, and to develop the structure of the frontend. We then divided the remaining API and styling into separate branches to complete those features. We then merged, tested, and deployed our project. 

If we had more time, we would add additional error messages to the registration and log-in forms, and add additional features to our API.
