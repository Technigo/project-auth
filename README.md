# Project Auth API

Simple Singup/Login authentication assignment.
Client: React
Server: Node.js server with Express framework

## The problem

It was tricky to handle browser default Cors-origin policy. I was confused by 400 status code with type: 'cors' by browser which turned out it was not cors errors but authentication error. After solving the issue by reading and displaying error message by using react-toastify library, I got clear understanding of 400 Bad Request (client fault).
