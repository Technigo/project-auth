# Project Auth

This project was about how to build a registration flow, how to handle authentication, both in the frontend and in the backend
and how to build a frontend and backend at the same time.

## The problem

We started with building the backend to get an accesstoken per user and added different routes depending if user had accesstoken or not. We had a minor problem by displaying our thougts after the user had logged in but we got help to solve that in our team session. If we had more time we would have focused on displaying better interactions with the user like better error messages etc.
The user can both create a user and sign in with existing user credentials.
