# Project Auth API
### Week 16 Technigo Bootcamp

With pair programming (Jennifer Feenstra-Areng√•rd & Nora Terbocs) we worked to create a backend to securely store passwords and user information. Our site handles user authentication with user tokens and this repo contains both backend and frontend projects.

## The problem

First we created the backend in the server.js we tried to visualize all of the endpoints we would need for our application and then created the get/post/patch requests required. Once the backend functionality was setup and we saw that we can store user data in our mongoAtlas database we created the components for the frontend and styled them with MUI. If we had more time we could do the rest of the stretch goals including implementing Google authentication with Firebase.
