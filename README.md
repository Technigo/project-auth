# Project Auth API

A simple authentication API built with Node.js and Express. It allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes with a valid token. The frontend is made with Tailwind CSS.


## The problem

I didnt understand the first codes that we were provided, I did everything a second time and used videos and lectures that I understood more of. If I had more time I would implement some sort of contact form in the /home directory and work more in the design.
