# Project Auth - Olga & Elin

This is a project to pratice authentication and authorization. The task was to create endpoints and UI for signing up, logging in/out and displaying some authenticated content for the user. The project utilises Express.js, MongoDB and React.

Our version of the project returns the user a random inspirational coding-related quote from our database.

## The problem

As we're handing this project in really late, the final project is already finished and approved. As most of the needed codes were "already there", we thought this one would've been really straightforward - however, we ran into at least as many errors connecting the backend and frontend of this one as with the final project. Problems especially arose after deploying everything, but many of them were mostly careless mistakes and lack of knowledge.

## View it live

Please note that the deployed backend is quite slow and the initial attempt to sign up or login might take a while!
