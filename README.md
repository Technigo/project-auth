# Project Auth API

For this project we built a backend and a frontend at the same time.
Using an API that was created in the backend we then used it to build a registration flow.
Other learning goals included:

- how to authenticate users using tokens
- How to securely store passwords in your databases
- How to handle authentication, both in the frontend and in the backend
