My reflections on how this week's project turned out:

- Overall it went well and it was fun to do our first real fullstack application!
- It was great to refresh our knowledge on so many different things, such as React Router, Redux Store.
- Really good to learn about authorization and how to create logins etc

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:

- As mentioned in the README we do still have one error which we don't know exactly what it means. Would be great to get some more explantion on this :)

"index.js:1 Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.
in LogIn (at App.js:43)"
