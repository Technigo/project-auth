# Project Auth API

Build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in. 

## The problem

Started with going through this weeks material, got started with the project through code-along. Finished the backend before starting with the frontend. Decided to use Redux store for easy storage of userinput and created a reusable form component with MUI.
