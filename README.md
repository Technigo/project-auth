# Project Auth API

This weeks project was done through pair-programming, a collaboration between Joanna Philips and Leo Thunell. The aim was to practice authentication and storing data in an API while taking adequate security measures when handling user data. During this week, we created a backend that handles requests and stores user data and a frontend connected to it which both display relevant error messages when called for.

## The problem

Some structure as to how login and register was to be done had to be reconsidered to make it as smooth of a user experience as possible, which took some time to remodel and get the right error messages on the front end.
