# Project Auth

This project was part of Technigo Bootcamp and this weeks assignment was to create a fullstack application - with focus on authentication. The requirement included creating a login and sign up functionality and some content which could only be shown for logged in users.

## The problem

We started with building the backend and all the routes and authenticators for the front end. We then set up the sign up and sign in components in the Frontend and setting up routes. Then we quite quickly realised we needed Redux store in order to keep track of the accesstoken. We also had time to set up local storage so that the user could refresh the page and still be logged in.

We had some issues with various error messages related to how we set up the backend with axios and we still have one error remaining related to useEffect in the logged in component which we are not sure how to solve. But we could successfully deploy everything and the app works so, we are not sure how this error could possibly effect our application.

If we had more time we would add some more specific error messages. We would also work a bit more on the frontend and make the logged-in site more complex and interesting. Maybe add a possibility for the user to post data to the database.
