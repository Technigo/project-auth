# Project Auth API

This is a pair programming project. The goal was to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, using access token and to securly save passwords in a database. We've also built a frontend with a form to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in. 

## The problem

We've built a React frontend, with React Router to navigate from sign in/register. We've been using Redux to dispatch actions for our users accessToken, username and errors.

The backend was made with Express API using Mongoose Schema and MongoDB. The users are authenticated with bcrypt.
