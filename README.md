# Project Auth

Fullstack pair programming project made by Amanda Tilly & Fatima Gomero Ramero. We have built API with authentication implementing a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some insider jokes once you're logged in.

## The problem

Our API has:

- Registration endpoint, to create a new user.
- Sign-in and sign-up endpoints, to authenticate a returning user.
- Endpoint to fetch all jokes.
- An authenticated endpoint which only returns content if the `Authorization` header with the user's token was correct.

Our frontend has:

- A registration form.
- A sign-in form.
- A page to show the authenticated jokes from the API.
