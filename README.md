# Project Auth

The purpose of this project was to practise creating an API with authentication where the user can register and view content once they are logged in.

## The problem

The first thing we did was to create all of the endpoints and the authentication needed for those. Then we created a user model for our database. We used bcrypt and crypto to encrypt the users password. Then we built a frontend with two routes to register or log in and a main page where the secret content is shown. The user has to log in to view and post to the main page. The most challenging part was writing a reducer for adding a new secret. If we had had more time we would have added styling.
