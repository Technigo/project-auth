# Project Auth

This is a pair programming project done by Hedvig Mejstedt and Maria Petersson.

In this project we focused on making a form where you can both log in and make a user. Then we made some content in a separate component that you only can access when you are logged in.

## The problem

We approached the problem through making a todo-list and checking off the list and at the same time we had a chat going so we did'nt work at the same problem at the same time. We worked mostly remote and discussed the code. We also coded together wen we had the opportunity.

If we had more time we would like to have some kind of warningtext for when the user wrote the wrong username of password.
