# Project Auth API

This project, completed as part of the Technigo bootcamp, involves developing a full-stack authentication system with a backend API and a React frontend. The project includes user registration and login functionalities, token-based authentication, and protected routes that require valid authentication tokens for access.

## The problem

The goal of this project was to create a secure user authentication system. The system allows users to register and log in, storing their credentials securely. Once logged in, users can access protected content that is only available to authenticated users. The primary challenge was ensuring the security of user data and tokens while providing a seamless user experience.

To create a secure user authentication system with a backend API and a React frontend, we planned the project by outlining the essential components and their interactions. The approach involved building a Node.js and Express backend with MongoDB for data storage, and bcrypt for password hashing. The frontend was developed using React, incorporating forms for user registration and login, with authenticated routes to manage secure content access. If given more time, we would enhance the validation and security features, add more user functionalities, and improve the user experience with better error handling.
