# Project Auth API

Our project was to create a sign in function for the user and also a what if the user forgets the password, how can they get a new one.

## The problem

Since this was a pairprogramming with Malin Lunde and Ulrika Gålnander we started up with dividing the different areas. We had some issue with the fetching, which was solved by Malins incredible knowledge in console logging. Fot this one we used bcrypt, react router and node.js.
