# Project Auth API

This React Redux project implements a full-stack application with a frontend and backend connected via an API. The API features registration and login routes, along with an authenticated endpoint. The frontend includes a registration form that communicates with the API to create new user accounts. Passwords in the database are encrypted using bcrypt, and the API performs input validation, returning error messages that can be displayed on the frontend.

## The problem

This project was done in pairs. We did some pair-programming and also did some programming apart using it branches that were merged. If we had more time we would implement the secret message in the backend instead of in the frontend. 
Tools: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, MongoDB Compass, MongoDB Atlas, Google Cloud.
