# Project Auth

This week we're learnt how to authenticate users and handle passwords with an API. We built the backend to be able to register and login users to access "secret" information. We also built a frontend to match and use the backend.

## The problem

The challenge was to later use an existing API in out project to fetch and post info to - only accessible when loged in. But that was solved by fetching in the frontend.
