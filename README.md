# Project Auth API

This project is an authentication API built with Express, MongoDB, and JWT for user registration, login, and accessing protected endpoints.

## The problem

The primary goal of this project is to implement user registration, authentication, and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The backend server, written in Express, handles user registration, login, and serves a protected endpoint with secret content accessible only to authenticated users. MongoDB is used as the database to store user information. 

Technologies Used:
Express: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend API.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user data.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for user authentication and authorization.
Bcrypt.js: Library for hashing passwords for secure storage.
dotenv: Used for loading environment variables from a .env file.
express-list-endpoints: Used for listing available endpoints in the root path.

Future Improvements:
If more time were available, some possible enhancements could include:

Implementing additional features such as user profile updates or password reset functionality.
Enhancing security measures and error handling.
Writing comprehensive unit and integration tests for the API.
Improving documentation for easier understanding and collaboration.
