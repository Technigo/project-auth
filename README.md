# Project Auth API
This project has it's focus on authentication. We had to create our own API, icluding authentication that integrates to a frontend. 
The main purpose is to connect everything that we have learned in this course.

## The problem

I had some struggle with the deployment on Vercel. It turned out to be minor change that had to be done in the vercel.json file to allow any host in the cors rules.

Code wise I had struggle with understanding, especially the frontend part. I had to split up all the tasks and steps in the process in order to structure my workload. I implemented useContext in this project, which is new to me as I only have used Zustand in a previous project where we digged deeper in to global state management. I did a lot of research to figure how to make it work.
I also found it quite tricky to grasp how local storage works and how to implement it.

To solve this questions I have used Google and chatGPT a lot.
