# Project Auth API

Create a registration and sign in form, leading to a "secret page" that ony users who are logged in can see. Frontend and backend working together.

## The problem

There were some troubles along the way, including tokens and secrets.
The main trouble in this project is deploying which we have really struggled with.
Atlas DB worked well, but render and netlify have been tricky. The frontend deploy seemed to be related to the connection to the backend deploy, including env variables.
