# Project Auth API

This project was about buildig a registration form. The user should be able to sign up and then sign in with the credentials. Once signed in the user should see something that would be accessable if not logged in. This fullstack project was built in a group of three people.
We started by setting up the backend and then the frontend.

## The problem
