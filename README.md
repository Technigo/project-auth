# Project Auth

This project is a full-stack authentication project with a simple registration and log in flow. The user is authenticated using tokens and passwords are stored securily in a dababase. Forms to register are built in the front end part. Only when the user is logged in they are able to view the protected content.

## The problem

The styling is unfortunately not yet finished. I run into problems with my styled components and the absolute and relative positionings which I finally solved with z-index. The styling will be developed more, same with returning something meaningful from the api.
