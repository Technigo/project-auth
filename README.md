# Project Auth API (MERN stack)

I had a lot of fun building my first full-stack project starting from a design draft on Figma, building an API and structuring components in react.

**Branches**
I have started working with Firebase Auth in the firebase branch but since I am currently short of time, this will be a stretch goal for later.

**Backend**
The API is built in node.js using Express and deployed on heroku. The data is stored in mongoDB.
API: https://libertas-auth.herokuapp.com/

**Frontend**
I chose to go with vanilla CSS but when I have time, I will implement SCSS (just need to get to know a bit more about how to best complie them.)

## Users should be able to:
- create an account
- sign in using *either* email address *or* username
- see how long they have been member for in a protected page (only logged in users allowed)

## View it live
