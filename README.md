# Project Authorization

As part of a Technigo Web Dev Bootcamp project, this project was created as a monorepo, with the backend including an API created using Express JS, MongoDB and Mongoose, and a frontend using a React. 

The API has four endpoints. One POST-method each for registering a user, and logging in a user. There is a possibility to GET a "secret" page, known as the Dashboard, which is only reachable through authentication. There is also a protected route for showing all users. This was used mainly for developmental purposes.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`MONGO_URL` - Get your Conncection String from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register).
