# Project Auth 

Pair-programming with petrabrink buildning an authorization app where you can sign up, log in and see a secret message.

## How did we do it

We used MongoDB to create the backend using Mongoose model for the user an bcrypt to crypt the password into hex-code that we then fetched into the frontend. The front-end is built in React using hooks. If we had more time we would of used react routes to sign up and log in trough different pages.
