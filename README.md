# Project Auth

This week's project has an API with authentication and validations to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in.

## What we have learnt

* How to authenticate users using tokens
* How to securely store passwords in your databases
* How to think about security and defensive design when building frontend or backend code

## The process and structure

We have reached the **BLUE LEVEL** ðŸ”µ and covered one thing at RED level.

At sign up we have messages in the frontend what goes wrong, for example if the password is invalid, we show that next to password input.

We decided to keep the frontend design basic to keep focus on:

* Backend authentication and validations 
* Frontend validation (on input fields)  


### Core Tech

**FRONTEND**

* React
* React Router
* Redux (with Thunks)
* Local Storage 
* Javascript

**BACKEND**

* Express
* Mongo DB
* Moongoose
* Heroku
* Postman
* MongoDB Compass
* Javascript
