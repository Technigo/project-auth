# Project Auth 20

Mission was to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in.


## The problem

We (Team Elsa & PÃ¥l) started by reading the brief and getting to know the code. We first worked on setting up the API backend and then on the frontend.
We got stuck a bit handling error codes. But after a day off we got through this and finished the project.
We coded in VS code with live share and also used Google Hangout to share our screens. We also used Chrome inspector, Postman and Mongo Compass to see and test the result.
We styled using Styled components.
It was a fun project and we learned a lot, and we had a great teamwork! 

- Error handling using Try/Catch.
- Using environment variables.
- Using async/await.
- Bcrypt and crypto
- Using react-router and redux
- Deployed API to Heroku and database to MongoDB Atlas cloud.
- Deployed frontend to Netlify.

#### Tech used: 
- Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas and JavaScript ES6
- VS Code, MongoDB Compass, Postman and Chrome.
