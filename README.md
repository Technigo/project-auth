# Project Auth API

In this week project we needed to create our backend with the specificatios of authenticate and user creation as well as handle passwords.
Once the backend was set up, we needed to link it to an user friendly frontend.

## The problem

On this project the technologies that we used were Mongoose and MongoDB for the backend and for the fronted we used React Hooks, Context and Navigate.
As a problem, we faced a bit of confussion on how our end-points would look in the frontend.
