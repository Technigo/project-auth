# Project Auth

This is the auth project for week 16.

A simple solution for testing out authorization, authentication and token blacklists.

a website where you can make a user, log in to a dash and log out.
if you are assigned a role as admin, you will se an login for cool admins in dash where you can go to do important admin stuff, such ass creating new users, adjusting data for users, assing roles and delete users. .. and log out

test admin : admin@admin.com / pass: admin
test user : user@user.com / pass: user

or make your own users if you like. admin has a separate login with more options, but easy to miss because the frontend got no love at all
